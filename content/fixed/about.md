Hello and welcome to my blog, my name is Ștefan Suciu, I'm a software
developer and I have a mechanical engineer degree.

I have 15+ years experience developing Perl GUI and CLI database
applications.  Some other interests of mine include data extraction
and manipulation, automation, amateur electronics, rock and pop.

I usually work with relational databases like Firebird, PostgreSQL,
SQLite, MySQL and CUBRID but also had some exposure to Access.

My favourite language is Perl and the new Perl6, and I also frequently
use Bash and SQL.  I'm also interested by Go(lang) and Pascal (Lazarus
| Delphi).

Some of the languages from my past are FoxPro (Visual FoxPro), DOS
batch, Basic (for Z80, Cub-Z, Windows) and Tcl/Tk.

I'm looking for a software developer job in the Brașov area and/or I'm
also available for remote work.

Thank you for your interest and I hope to get some feedback from you
about the articles on this blog.
