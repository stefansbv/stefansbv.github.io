Hello, and welcome to my blog, my name is Ștefan Suciu, I'm a software
developer and I have a mechanical engineer degree.

I have 15+ years experience developing Perl GUI and CLI database
applications.

I like to learn about, and experiment with different technologies, so
my knowledge is rather wide than deep, excepting the above mentioned
experience.

Another of my relatively newer field of interest is for Web
development.  This blog uses the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) static site
generator, but my former *s2i2.ro* site was created using the [Perl
Dancer](http://perldancer.org/) web application framework, but also
published as a static site.

Some other interests of mine include data extraction and manipulation,
automation, amateur electronics, rock and pop.

I usually work with relational databases like Firebird, PostgreSQL,
SQLite, MySQL and CUBRID but also had some exposure to Access.

My favourite language is Perl and the new Perl6, and I also frequently
use Bash and SQL.  I'm also interested by Go(lang) and Pascal (Lazarus
| Delphi).

Some of the languages from my past are FoxPro (Visual FoxPro), DOS
batch, Basic (for Z80, Cub-Z, Windows) and Tcl/Tk.

I'm looking for a software developer job in the Brașov area and/or I'm
also available for remote work.

Thank you for your interest and I hope to get some feedback from you
about the articles on this blog.
