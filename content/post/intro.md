title: Intro

This is my introductory post on my new blog.  My plan is to publish
here short articles about my software and hardware projects and about
my experiments.  Also this could be a good place for safekeeping
notes, tips and tricks.


### Acknowledgements

This blog is hosted on GitHub Pages and generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), uses "A reserved Jekyll theme that places the utmost gravity on content with a hidden drawer, made by @mdo", and adapted for Hugo by @tummychow ([lanyon-hugo](http://tummychow.github.io/lanyon-hugo)).

The build, deploy and publish task is automated using [Werker](http://wercker.com/), and the setup was made using the tutorial from the Hugo docs made by @ArjenSchwarz, [Automated deployments with Wercker](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/automated-deployments/)

Thank you.
